# CryptoManager

CryptoManager is a web application that allows users to track the latest prices of popular cryptocurrencies. Users can add multiple cryptocurrencies to their dashboard, view their current prices in euros, and remove them as needed.

## Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It utilizes React for the frontend and Axios for fetching cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.
